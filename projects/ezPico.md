#h3 Description
Hi, intrepid investigator! üìÑüîç You've stumbled upon a peculiar PDF filled with what seems like nothing more than garbled nonsense. But beware! Not everything is as it appears. Amidst the chaos lies a hidden treasure‚Äîan elusive flag waiting to be uncovered.
Find the PDF file here Hidden Confidential Document and uncover the flag within the metadata.
