            <h4>Underemployment</h4>
            <i>Noun: lack of paid work or work that makes full use of skills and abilities</i>
            <p>The past seven months at work have been a complete bore. I come in, sit at my desk and either do my schoolwork or sit around for hours doing nothing.
                This isnt for lack of work that my job needs to get done, but more the utter mundaneness of the work that is required of me. I sit around waiting for tickets to come in
                and when they do its ususally something completly meaingless that only takes fifty seconds to complete. Like add my printer, or change my mouse batteries.
                This stuff is completly beneath me. Like I understand the concept of paying your dues in the gruntwork, but at this point I feel its a waste of my time and energy.
                When I interned here I was involved in so much more stuff, and had access to tools that are now restriced from me. I feel like since I got on here I have been hearing platitudes
                like, "oh when we bring you full time you will have more access and be more involved." I have been here for five months now, one would be under the assumption that I would be formally 
                hired by now, yet I'm still a temp.  
            </p>
            <p>I feel that I also do not have a good enough resume to find another place to work, my friend recently reccomened me to send my resume in to this remote soc position and I am afraid for two reasons,
                the first is obviously that I won't get it, I don't have any certs and my last meaningful involvement in CTF's was almost a year ago now. And secondly I am afraid of what working in 
                private industry would entail, as I feel I would likely be let go after a few months bc the ecnomy and job market are hot ass right now. 
            </p>
            <p>At the end of the day it's been so long since I have felt like im utlizig my skills here at work and its killing any work ethic I have here, secondly since I am the youngest at the office I'm basically getting constant baby talk
                and its vile and annoying. I also feel like I am getting disrespected in a way, doing all this mundane shit when my skillset THAT THEY KNOW I HAVE is just being left to rot.
                When the most meaingful thing I've done at work today is write this blog, that should tell you all you need to know.

            <h4>TOO MANY PROJECTS</h4>
            <i>why do i do this to myself...</i>
            <p> So over the course of my summer, in between my gradschool classes and work I've been tinkering around with a few project ideas.
                A few ideas have flown around in my head, some easy but expensive, some hard but cheap, and others are just a pipedream. They seem to fall into three categories:</p>
            <p>Server and Personal PC projects<br>Home Projects<br>And hobby projects</p>
            <p>The PC and Server projects is not anything that is software related and is entirely a hardware problem, upgrades people upgrades!!!<br>
                My Personal PC is begenning to show her age in the processor department given that the Ryzen chipset that is installed into it is from 2019, so If I want tarkov to preform better
                I need something newer. The server would of course see the upgrades in chipset once it gets retired from my main pc but there are things othen that that I want to upgrade there as well.
                How I run the server is off of a partition on a 2tb hard disk, the rest is reserved for a samba share acting as my main media storage location and its running out of space, so I need to come 
                up with a solution. That soultion would be a NAS, im leaning twoards a truenas container hosted inside of my proxmox hypervisor. The only issue is that the case my server is in does not have any space for
                more drive bays, so i'll need a case with space for at least three hard drives, the main and the two I plan to run in raid, and two ideally 4tb each drives. This all in all is looking to be very very expensive...
            </p>
            <p>My next set of projects is things for around the house, I need to fix the door on our outside shed as the lock isnt even attached to the doorframe, so I would need to buy a drill for that 
                I would also need to buy a new lock for it as well. From there I need to install something for cable routing at the switch in the drum room, as the cables are just laying on the floor and its a tripping hazard.
                Im thinking of a wall mounted solution so I can route cables both below and above the door to the room and into mine and my roommates rooms. Finally would need to find some more decorations as well.
            </p>
            <p>And then the personal hobby projects, the gunpla backlog has gotten officially too long! Im still working on the Vidar, and I've got at least three kits in the backlog and a T72 in there as well. I also have a
                arduino project that I fear im way over my head on, its going to be a gif player for a cosplay peice that my coworker wanted me to work on and I have been running into so many issues with it. This all 
                culminates on the various other pages on this website, like the planned projects page and model kit page which im still sorta figuring out what I want to do with them. Working a fulltime job just draines
                the life out of me, and I have no time to work on these projects. (Totally not writing this at work right now...)

        <h4>New Place, New Job, New Everything</h4>
        <i>MAJOR LIFE UPDATES (sorta)</i>
        <p>So its def been a little while since I've updated this blog. And a lot has definitely changed in the last few months...
        To get a recap on the last four months, I moved out of my parents house and moved back down to South Florida with a friend of mine.
        We were able to find a pretty good deal on a nice townhouse, being the one who did all the legwork and manages all the billing I of 
        course was entitled to the master bedroom with the private bathroom.<br>
        I got a job back at where I interned at during my time as a undergrad.
        So it's nice to finally be making some scratch, pay is good but the work is really boring not going to lie, at least right now its just 
        help desk work which I feel is a little below my skillset and what I would like to be doing, but I have this job so that I can pay for 
        certifications and grad school. The vibes here are very different as to when I was an intern due to some workplace shenangians that happened
        after my Internship concluded, its hard to describe how it feels like rn but the best words I have for it are, it's kinda walk on eggshells-y<br>
        Also I began taking my online gradschool classes, I really wish I didn't slack off for so long, because if I put in a modicum of more effort
        I would probably be in the dedicated engineering dept cybersecurity masters, instead of the cyber and intelligence online one through the school of arts and sci.
        But that same mentality can be applied for the Job I have as well, I really should get an adderall scrip....<br>
        All in all things are finally moving along in my life, and I am not happy but content per say, just going to work to make sure my cat is fed 
        and that all my coursework is caught up with. </p>

            <h4>Marvel Rivals</h4>
            <i>Im retiring from being a tank main</i>
            <p>I finally started playing Rivals, its pretty fun...<br>however the main issue I have is that from my years playing 
            overwatch, hero shooters have the ablity to make me irrationaly angry.<br> and like you really dont get how schzio it can make me<br>
            Back when I seriously played overwatch in late Highschool is was a dead serious tank main, and we even played competitive hs espors, 
            in retrospec that shit was a lil cringe. <br> So im like incompreseinbly easily ragebaitable when it comes to playing games like these. <br>
            but I've been having alot of fun playing Star Lord and Luna and Spider Man so its like I've basically cast off the yoke of being a tank main...

            <h4>First post in the blog</h4>
            <i>website development, hosting, this and that</i>
            <p> Welcome to the very first entry in my blog, I've been planning on making a webpage and finding a way of securely hosting it.
                So this is sorta the braindump talking about my experiences, trobules, and overall learning in the process so far.
            </p>
            <p>This is the second page that ive made when it comes to my website, and I wanted to branch out to using a different design compared to the first page, the homepage,
                this one I tried to go for more of a web2 vibe that I remember from my childhood. So it was a good re-learning in good ol blocky design and css gruntwork that I did
                back in my webdev class in my junior year of college two years ago now (man I feel old).<br>
                <img src="images/oldaf.gif" alt="" style="width: 75px; height: 75px;">
            </p>
            <p>Enough rambling.</p>
            <p>This has been a really enjoyable project so far, I've totally learned how much I "Love" css. But I know that boradning my skills in general is a great overall
                practice.<br>
                The biggest struggle so in the creation of this blog page blog section? was the Recent Track section to the left. That section there took like two days of
                troubleshooting, asking questions, and testing. Due to the fact that at the time of this blogpost being written the webpage isn't yet there was issues regarding CORS
                which was leading to no info being sent to me after my constructed get request. I figure ill be able to remove it once it goes live, but for now Ill enjoy the blissful 
                workaround that I found <a href="https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo">here</a>.
