          <h4>New Place, New Job, New Everything</h4>
          <i>MAJOR LIFE UPDATES (sorta)</i>
          <p>So its def been a little while since I've updated this blog. And a lot has definitely changed in the last few months...
          To get a recap on the last four months, I moved out of my parents house and moved back down to South Florida with a friend of mine.
          We were able to find a pretty good deal on a nice townhouse, being the one who did all the legwork and manages all the billing I of 
          course was entitled to the master bedroom with the private bathroom.<br>
          I got a job back at where I interned at during my time as a undergrad.
          So it's nice to finally be making some scratch, pay is good but the work is really boring not going to lie, at least right now its just 
          help desk work which I feel is a little below my skillset and what I would like to be doing, but I have this job so that I can pay for 
          certifications and grad school. The vibes here are very different as to when I was an intern due to some workplace shenangians that happened
          after my Internship concluded, its hard to describe how it feels like rn but the best words I have for it are, it's kinda walk on eggshells-y<br>
          Also I began taking my online gradschool classes, I really wish I didn't slack off for so long, because if I put in a modicum of more effort
          I would probably be in the dedicated engineering dept cybersecurity masters, instead of the cyber and intelligence online one through the school of arts and sci.
          But that same mentality can be applied for the Job I have as well, I really should get an adderall scrip....<br>
          All in all things are finally moving along in my life, and I am not happy but content per say, just going to work to make sure my cat is fed 
          and that all my coursework is caught up with. </p>

            <h4>Marvel Rivals</h4>
            <i>Im retiring from being a tank main</i>
            <p>I finally started playing Rivals, its pretty fun...<br>however the main issue I have is that from my years playing 
            overwatch, hero shooters have the ablity to make me irrationaly angry.<br> and like you really dont get how schzio it can make me<br>
            Back when I seriously played overwatch in late Highschool is was a dead serious tank main, and we even played competitive hs espors, 
            in retrospec that shit was a lil cringe. <br> So im like incompreseinbly easily ragebaitable when it comes to playing games like these. <br>
            but I've been having alot of fun playing Star Lord and Luna and Spider Man so its like I've basically cast off the yoke of being a tank main...

            <h4>First post in the blog</h4>
            <i>website development, hosting, this and that</i>
            <p> Welcome to the very first entry in my blog, I've been planning on making a webpage and finding a way of securely hosting it.
                So this is sorta the braindump talking about my experiences, trobules, and overall learning in the process so far.
            </p>
            <p>This is the second page that ive made when it comes to my website, and I wanted to branch out to using a different design compared to the first page, the homepage,
                this one I tried to go for more of a web2 vibe that I remember from my childhood. So it was a good re-learning in good ol blocky design and css gruntwork that I did
                back in my webdev class in my junior year of college two years ago now (man I feel old).<br>
                <img src="images/oldaf.gif" alt="" style="width: 75px; height: 75px;">
            </p>
            <p>Enough rambling.</p>
            <p>This has been a really enjoyable project so far, I've totally learned how much I "Love" css. But I know that boradning my skills in general is a great overall
                practice.<br>
                The biggest struggle so in the creation of this blog page blog section? was the Recent Track section to the left. That section there took like two days of
                troubleshooting, asking questions, and testing. Due to the fact that at the time of this blogpost being written the webpage isn't yet there was issues regarding CORS
                which was leading to no info being sent to me after my constructed get request. I figure ill be able to remove it once it goes live, but for now Ill enjoy the blissful 
                workaround that I found <a href="https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo">here</a>.
